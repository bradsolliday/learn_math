# learn_math
My nieces are in elementary school and I remember a software "fast math" which taught me my multiplication table.
I couldn't find the program to suggest to my sister (their mother), so I figured I'd try making a clone. I now recall that the program from my youth was called FASTT Math, but I've already started on the project and figured it would be a good exercise in making a desktop application with a gui.
